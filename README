CGI::Auth::Auto

CGI::Auth comes with extra files you would place in your hosting account. It comes with a tool to manage users, 
with a template, etc.

Included in this distribution is a slightly cuslom template which I like more then the one that comes with 
CGI::Auth. The tempalte in cgi-bin/auth/login.html is more vague, has no colors, etc. This is the template I like
mote.


The included user.dat file has a user named 'default' with password 'default'.

There is also a test script in cgi-bin/cgi_auth_auto_test.cgi to get you up and running.

Make sure you have CGI::Auth available on your server.

Please forward comments, problems, etc to Leo Charre, leo (at) leocharre (dot) com.
